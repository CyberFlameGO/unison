Tests for an unsound case of ability checking that was erroneously being
accepted before. In certain cases, abilities were able to be added to rows in
invariant positions.

```unison
structural type Runner g = Runner (forall a. '{g} a -> {} a)

pureRunner : Runner {}
pureRunner = Runner base.force

-- this compiles, but shouldn't the effect type parameter on Runner be invariant?
runner : Runner {IO}
runner = pureRunner
```

```ucm

  The expression in red needs the {IO} ability, but this location does not have access to any abilities.
  
      8 | runner = pureRunner
  

```
