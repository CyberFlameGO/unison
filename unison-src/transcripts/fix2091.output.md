  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ‚çü These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      structural type type! type_ ability_
      unique type type!!! type_ ability_
      ability!      : ##Nat
      ability''     : ##Nat
      ability1      : ##Nat
      ability_1     : ##Nat
      type!         : ##Nat
      type'         : ##Nat
      type_         : ##Nat
      typesAndTerms : ##Text
